# image-carousel

## Overview

Carousel is used to show images in a slideshow. This template is responsive so it will display gorgeously on all screen types including mobiles and computers. In addition, our carousel will automatically change its size to fit the imageâ€™s size.

## Usage

Carousels are often used to display a series of looping images. There are some other popular usages of carousel. Some of them are:

* Teasers   
  * Articles     
  * Entire sections of web pages

### How to Use

1. Download the carousel template from Neutrinos store.  
2. Install the template into N-Studio. 
3. When creating a new app, select the carousel template from the **ENTER APP DETAILS** menu and click on the create button.
4. Create a component \(Example:carousel\) 
5. In **TS** file 
6. Import services: one service based on user requirements \(Example: imageservice\) and another, carousel service, which contains **observable media**- used for tracking the responsiveness.

   ```typescript
   import{imageserviceService}from'../../services/imageservice/imageservice.service';
   ```

   ```typescript
   import { carouselserviceService } from  '../../services/carouselservice/carouselservice.service';
   ```

* Inject the two services in 'constructor'

  ```typescript
  constructor(private  imgService:imageserviceService,private  cService:carouselserviceService) {
  }
  ```

* Inside **class**, declare the variables used

  ```typescript
    imagedata : String ;
    limit : any ;
  ```

* In **ngOnInit**

  `this.imageData = this.imgService.getImages();`

> **imagedata** - Variable used in imageservice. **imgservice** - Keyword for the service.

* write a function

  ```typescript
    ngDoCheck() { 
    this.limit = this.cService.assignLimit(1, 2, 4); 
    }
  ```

> **limit** - Variable used in carouselservice. **cservice** - Keyword for the service. **ngDoCheck\(\)** - Function used for tracking the responsiveness.

* In **HTML** file

  Drag and drop a custom html to call the child component

  ```markup
  <bh-carousel [imageData]="imageData"[limitImage]="limit" *ngIf="imageData"></bh-carousel>
  ```

> **carousel**- Name of the child component.
