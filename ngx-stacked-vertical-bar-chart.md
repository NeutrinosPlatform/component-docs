# Stacked Vertical Bar Chart

## Overview

A  Stacked Vertical Bar Chart is similar to the normal bar chart with a difference that in a stacked vertical bar chart, the data values are plotted using a vertical bar \(column direction\). It provides a good comparison of the data which is placed in the column direction."

## Usage

A Stacked Vertical Bar Chart is widely used in industries, health centers, Data analysis, IT companies etc. The use case for stacked vertical bar chart depends on the scope where it is being used. For example, the insurance companies use this chart to display the report of all the insured clients categorized under male or female in particular year or months, IT \(Information Technology\) companies use this chart for the analysis of the products and services used by their clients. Similarly, in the health domain, this chart is used for the treatment analysis and new drugs research data analysis. In all these scopes of the domain, the main use of a stacked vertical bar chart is for comparison of data categorized on different parameters. There are some other popular use cases where stacked vertical bar chart is used. Some of them are:

* Insurance companies
* Industries 
* Health centers
* Data analysis

### How to use

1. Open the newly created page.
2. Drag and drop a **Stacked Vertical Bar Chart** from **Ngx Charts** palette section.
3. Switch to the **Ts** file of the page and then declare the variable and provide values for the dataset. A sample is given below: 
   * Dataset which consists of all other parameters like labels, and legends. 

     ```javascript
       dataSet = [
       {
       "name": "Germany",
       "series": [
         {
           "name": "2010",
           "value": 7300000
         },
         {
           "name": "2011",
           "value": 8940000
         }
       ]
       },
       {
       "name": "USA",
       "series": [
         {
           "name": "2010",
           "value": 7870000
         },
         {
           "name": "2011",
           "value": 8270000
         }
       ]
       }
       ];
     ```
4. Now switch back to the Html file of the page and provide the dataset array name in the \[datasets\] attribute. For example,

   ```text
        [results] = dataSet
   ```

5. X-axis label can be shown or hidden by providing, `[xAxis] = true` OR `[xAxis] = false`.
6. Y-axis label can be shown or hidden by providing, `[yAxis] = true` OR `[yAxis] = false`.
7. Legends can be shown or hidden by providing, `[legend] = true` OR `[legend] = false`.
8. Save the page and run the application.

### Example

Consider an industry scenario which records the number of clients who use their products and services. The company plots the data on the stacked vertical bar chart to get a better comparison. For example,

| Country | Products | Services |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2016** | 365452 | 265482 |
| **2017** | 345245 | 275825 |

#### Datasets

Here is a sample of a dataset that is declared and initialized in the component class **Ts** file of the project.

```javascript
dataSet = [
  {
    "name": "Products",
    "series": [
      {
        "name": "2016",
        "value": 365452
      },
      {
        "name": "2017",
        "value": 345245
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Services",
    "series": [
      {
        "name": "2016",
        "value": 265482
      },
      {
        "name": "2017",
        "value": 275825
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

#### Labels

Here, the labels are automatically taken from the dataset. The label will be **'name'** for the y-axis and **'values'** for the x-axis

#### Legend

Here is a sample of the legend that is declared and initialized in the component class of **Ts** file of the project.

```javascript
 [legend] = true;
```

This legend is taken from the dataset and displayed on the right side of the chart by default. Only the **name** parameter is taken into the legend section.

## Associated Attributes

* **Gradient \(Color/color hexadecimal code\):** Gradient is a combination of different color patterns and styles which are used to fill the vertical bars in the chart. For example,

  ```css
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #33ccff 0%, #ff99cc 100%)
  ```

* **\[xAxis\] \(True/False\):** This attribute diplays the level for the x-axis. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
  [xAxis] = 'True' OR [xAxis] = 'False'
  ```

* **\[yAxis\] \(True/False\):** This attribute diplays the level for the y-axis as like x-axis. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
   [yAxis] = 'True' OR [yAxis] = 'False'
  ```

* **Legends \(Boolean\):** It displays the category of data that is used in plotting the stacked vertical bar chart. If it is true, it shows the legends otherwise it does not show.
* **\[xAxisLabel\] \(String\):** It gives the name to the x-axis.  For example,

  ```typescript
    [xAxisLabel] = "Types of services"
  ```

* **\[yAxisLabel\] \(String\):** It gives the name to the y-axis.  For example,

  ```typescript
    [yAxisLabel] = "No of Clients"
  ```

* **\[showXAxisLabel\] \(True/False\):** It displays the name that is given to the \[xAxisLabel\]. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
   [showXAxisLabel]  = 'True' OR [showXAxisLabel]  = 'False'
  ```

* **\[showYAxisLabel\] \(True/False\):** It displays the name that is given to the \[yAxisLabel\]. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
   [showYAxisLabel] = 'True' OR [showYAxisLabel] = 'False'
  ```

* **Key:** Key is used to provide user custom key point into the chart. It is like a userâ€™s custom parameter provided to the chart section.
* **Value:** It is a value of the key that the user provided manually. For example,
* **Style:** It accepts a string value and affects the different properties \(height, width, color etc.\) of the component based on the values provided \(eg. `background: orange; height:200px`;\).
* **Class:** "Class" attribute is used to point to a class in a style sheet. A class contains one or more style statements. Classes are created inside the "Style" tab which is opened by selecting the "Style" side menu. The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names \(eg. class1 class2\) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.

  ```css
    .class1 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
    .class2 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
  ```

* **select \(Events\):** It takes a click event which is done on the bars of the chart. It displays some result on click or on hover of the mouse. For example, displaying data points and/or the labels on click of individual bars.
* **scheme:** It is a color scheme of the chart. For example,

  ```typescript
  let colorSets = [
    {
      name: 'vivid',
      selectable: true,
      group: 'Ordinal',
      domain: ['#647c8a', '#3f51b5', '#2196f3', '#00b862', '#afdf0a', '#a7b61a', '#f3e562', '#ff9800', '#ff5722', '#ff4514'
      ]
    } ];
  ```

* **Results \(object\[\]\):** It provide a data to the chart which is plotted on a graph using vertical bars. For example,

  ```typescript
  dataSet=[
   {
     "name": "India",
     "value": 135148
   },
   {
     "name": "United States",
     "value": 121652
   },
   {
     "name": "Germany",
     "value": 157885
   },
   {
     "name": "France",
     "value": 965782
   },
   {
     "name": "United Kingdom",
     "value": 987564
   }
  ]
  ```

* **fxLayout:** It is a flex layout provided to the chart. It provides different orientations such as row orientation, column orientation to the chart. For example, 

  ```typescript
  fxLayout = 'row' OR fxLayout = 'column'
  ```

* **fxFlex:** It is a directive for fxLayout which is used on it for resizing the elements within the flexbox container flow. It provides three options i.e fxFlex Grow, fxFlex shrink, and fxFlex basis. Here is an example of the implementation of fxFlex.

  ```markup
  <div fxFlex="<grow> <shrink> <basis>"></div>
  ```
