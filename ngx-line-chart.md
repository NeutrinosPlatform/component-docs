# Line Chart

## Overview

A Line Chart is a chart that plots the data values using a line and connects those points using a straight line. It does not contain any background color."

## Usage

A Line Chart is widely used in comparing trending data such as stock market shares. The use case for a line chart depends on the scope where it is being used. For example, industries use a line chart to display the report of all their products used by clients from different geographical regions, IT \(Information Technology\) companies use this chart for the analysis of the products and services used by their clients. Similarly, in the health domain, this chart is used for treatment analysis and new drugs research data analysis. In all these scopes of the domain, the main use of a line chart is for comparison of data categorized on different parameters. There are some other popular use cases where a line chart is used. Some of them are:

* Insurance companies
* Industries 
* Health centers
* Data analysis

### How to use

1. Open the newly created page.
2. Drag and drop a **Line Chart** from **Ngx Charts** palette section.
3. Switch to the **Ts** file of the page and then declare the variable and provide values for the dataset. A sample is given below:- 
   * Dataset which consists of all other parameters like labels, and legends. 

     ```typescript
       dataSet = [
     {
       "name": "Germany",
       "series": [
         {
           "name": "2010",
           "value": 7300000
         },
         {
           "name": "2011",
           "value": 8940000
         }
       ]
     },
     {
       "name": "USA",
       "series": [
         {
           "name": "2010",
           "value": 7870000
         },
         {
           "name": "2011",
           "value": 8270000
         }
       ]
       }
       ];
     ```
4. Now switch back to the Html file of the page and provide the dataset array name in the \[datasets\] attribute. For example,

   ```text
        [results] = dataSet
   ```

5. X-axis label can be shown or hidden by providing, `[xAxis] = true` OR `[xAxis] = false`.
6. Y-axis label can be shown or hidden by providing, `[yAxis] = true` OR `[yAxis] = false`.
7. Legends can be shown or hidden by providing, `[legend] = true` OR `[legend] = false`.
8. Save the page and run the application.

### Example

Consider an Insurance company which records the data of their clients from different countries. The company plots the data on a line chart to get better comparison of variations in the number of clients from the different countries. For example,

| Country | Germany | USA |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2010** | 7300000 | 7870000 |
| **2011** | 8940000 | 8270000 |

#### Datasets:

Here is a sample of a dataset that is declared and initialized in the component class **Ts** file of the project.

```typescript
dataSet = [
  {
    "name": "Germany",
    "series": [
      {
        "name": "2010",
        "value": 7300000
      },
      {
        "name": "2011",
        "value": 8940000
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "USA",
    "series": [
      {
        "name": "2010",
        "value": 7870000
      },
      {
        "name": "2011",
        "value": 8270000
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

#### Labels:

Here, the labels are automatically taken from the dataset. The label will be **'name'** for the y-axis and **'values'** for the x-axis

#### Legend

Here is a sample of the legend that is declared and initialized in the component class of **Ts** file of the project.

```typescript
 [legend] = true;
```

This legend is taken from the dataset, and displayed on the right side of the chart by default. Only the **name** parameter is taken into the legend section.

## Associated Attributes

* **Gradient \(Color/color hexadecimal code\):** Gradient is a combination of different color patterns and styles. For example,

  ```css
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #33ccff 0%, #ff99cc 100%)
  ```

* **\[xAxis\] \(True/False\):** This attribute diplays the x-axis points. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
  [xAxis] = 'True' OR [xAxis] = 'False'
  ```

* **\[yAxis\] \(True/False\):** This attribute diplays the y-axis points. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
   [yAxis] = 'True' OR [yAxis] = 'False'
  ```

* **Legends \(Boolean\):** It displays the categories of data that are used in plotting the line chart. If it is true, it shows the legends otherwise it does not show.
* **\[xAxisLabel\] \(String\):** It gives the name to the x-axis.  For example,

  ```typescript
    [xAxisLabel] = "Country"
  ```

* **\[yAxisLabel\] \(String\):** It gives the name to the y-axis.  For example,

  ```typescript
    [yAxisLabel] = "No. of Clients"
  ```

* **\[showXAxisLabel\] \(True/False\):** It displays the name that is given to the \[xAxisLabel\]. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
   [showXAxisLabel]  = 'True' OR [showXAxisLabel]  = 'False'
  ```

* **\[showYAxisLabel\] \(True/False\):** It displays the name that is given to the \[yAxisLabel\]. If it is true, it will display otherwise it does not. For example,

  ```typescript
   [showYAxisLabel] = 'True' OR [showYAxisLabel] = 'False'
  ```

* **Key:** Key is used to provide user custom key point into the chart. It is like a userâ€™s custom parameter provided to the chart section.
* **Value:** It is a value of the key that the user provided manually.
* **Style:** It accepts a string value and affects the different properties \(height, width, color etc.\) of the component based on the values provided \(eg. background: orange; height:200px;\).
* **Class:** "Class" attribute is used to point to a class in a style sheet. A class contains one or more style statements. Classes are created inside the "Style" tab which is opened by selecting the "Style" side menu. The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names \(eg. class1 class2\) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.

  ```css
    .class1 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
    .class2 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
  ```

* **select \(Events\):** It takes a click event which is done on the bars of the chart. It displays some result on click or on hover of mouse. For example, displaying data point or label on click of individual lines.
* **scheme:** It is a color scheme of the chart. For example,

  ```typescript
  let colorSets = [
    {
      name: 'vivid',
      selectable: true,
      group: 'Ordinal',
      domain: ['#647c8a', '#3f51b5', '#2196f3', '#00b862', '#afdf0a', '#a7b61a', '#f3e562', '#ff9800', '#ff5722', '#ff4514'
      ]
    } ];
  ```

* **Results \(object\[\]\):** It provide a data to the chart which is plotted on a graph using lines. For example,

  ```typescript
  dataSet = [
    {
      "name": "Germany",
      "series": [
        {
          "name": "2010",
          "value": 7300000
        },
        {
          "name": "2011",

        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "USA",
      "series": [
        {
          "name": "2010",
          "value": 7870000
        },
        {
          "name": "2011",
          "value": 8270000
        }
      ]
    }
  ];
  ```

* **fxLayout:** It is a flex layout provided to the chart. It provides different orientation such as row orientation, column orientation to the chart. For example, 

  ```typescript
  fxLayout = 'row' OR fxLayout = 'column'
  ```

* **fxFlex:** It is a directive for fxLayout which is used on it for resizing the elements within the flexbox container flow. It provides three options i.e fxFlex Grow, fxFlex shrink, and fxFlex basis. Here is an example of the implementation of fxFlex.

  ```markup
  <div fxFlex="<grow> <shrink> <basis>"></div>
  ```
